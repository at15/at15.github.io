\datedsubsection{\textbf{AWS}: Software Engineer - Amazon CloudWatch and X-Ray}{Vancouver, Canada \quad Sep 2020 - Present \quad}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Led a team of 6 engineers to implement W3C trace ID support in AWS X-Ray.
	Refactored data sharding and indexing logic to remove X-Ray trace ID timestamp dependency, unblocking 20,000 AWS accounts and enabling OpenTelemetry integration.
	\item Collaborated with Lambda and Application Signals teams to integrate OpenTelemetry in X-Ray ingestion API. Reduced Python Lambda function cold start time by 60\% by removing OpenTelemetry collector from the Lambda layer.
	\item Designed and implemented conversion logic between OpenTelemetry trace spans, 
	\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/devguide/xray-api-segmentdocuments.html}{X-Ray segments} and 
	\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-Transaction-Search.html}{CloudWatch transaction search log events},
	reducing customer trace data storage cost by 70\% using log storage so they can sample 100\% traces.
	\item Maintainer of open source projects on GitHub: \href{https://github.com/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent}{Amazon CloudWatch Agent} and \href{https://github.com/aws-observability/aws-otel-collector}{Amazon Distro of OpenTelemetry Collector}.
	\item Developed the \href{https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/extension/observer/ecsobserver}{ECS extension} for \href{https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib}{OpenTelemetry Collector},
	enabling Prometheus discovery with metadata from ControlPlane.
\end{itemize}

	\item Developed a Go-based monitoring tool to correlate logs, metrics, and traces on deployment failures, automatically identifying root causes base on topology. This reduced on-call debug time from 10 minutes to 2 minutes.
	\item Introduced canary deployment strategy and dependency readiness check, reducing deployment rollback ratio by 20\%.
	% TODO: number? I think I mentioned this because this is k8s crd, which is also what I did in Google ...
	%\item Built Kubernetes operator for running stateful services like database with in house underlay container network solution.
\end{itemize}
