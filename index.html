        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>
            I am a first year graduate student in <a href="https://www.ucsc.edu/" target="_blank">University of California Santa Cruz</a> learning Computer Science. I am looking for joining distributed systems related research group in UCSC and summer
            internship on 2017.
        </p>

        <p>
            I have done research in distributed system monitoring in <a href="http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/" target="_blank">Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China</a> with <a href="http://english.seiee.sjtu.edu.cn/english/detail/841_650.htm" target="_blank">Prof. Cao</a>            for 8 month on a collaborative project with China Telecom, Shanghai. During a two month visist in <a href="https://www.vu.edu.au/" target="_blank">Victoria University, Australia</a>, I have done research in web crawling and text mining with
            <a href="https://www.vu.edu.au/contact-us/jing-he" target="_blank">Prof. Jing</a> to estimate AFL sportsmen's comercial value.
        </p>

        <p>
            I am a fullstack web developer and former president of <a href="http://dongyueweb.com/" target="_blank">Dongyue Web Studio</a>, where students build web and mobile application for non-profit orgnizations and startups. I am also the former
            architect for <a href="http://tongqu.me" target="_blank">Tongqu</a>, an online campus event platform with more than 10,000 active users and solved high concurrency problem with limited hardware resouce.
        </p>

        <p>
            <!-- TODO: add links to refer to work and skills -->
            Before going to UCSC I studied Masterial Science in <a href="http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/" target="_blank">Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China</a> as my parents are all professors in related field. However I found I got more interest and talent
            in computer science. Apart from the CS sources I took in SJTU, the experience in Dongyue Web Studio is turly valueable. I got chance to learn cutting edge technologies in web development and parctice with amazing collegues on real projects
            like Tongqu. Started as a novice front end developer and ended up being a full stack developer and the studio president, I gained experience about team work and how to let the project ship in time - stop creating wheels and over optimization,
            iterate rapidly.
        </p>

        <p>
            I am quite active on <a href="https://github.com/at15">GitHub</a>, contributing to opensource projects and creating wheels with my friends in <a href="https://github.com/dyweb">Dongyue Web Studio</a> and <a href="https://github.com/tongquhq">Tongqu</a>.

            <p>
                GitCafe is the earliest git hosting company in China, focusing on enterprise and education, it is now accquired by Coding.net. I met Rainux and Simsicon on Hackshanghai hackathon during road show and got an internship opportunity. I worked as a Ruby engineer
                during school's winter vacation. I closed a lot of tickets and fixed some nasty encoding problem caused by third party libraries. Also my knowledge for Git itself and Git workflow increased a lot since GitCafe is a git hosting company.
