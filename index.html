        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>
            I am a SDE at PayPal working on container (cans and bottles). I got my master degree in
            <a href="https://www.ucsc.edu/"
                target="_blank">UCSC</a>
            and bachelor degree in
            <a href="http://http://www.sjtu.edu.cn/" target="_blank">SJTU</a>. My main interests are time series database (see
            <a href="https://github.com/xephonhq" target="_blank">Xephon</a>) and database benchmark (see
            <a href="https://github.com/benchhub" target="_blank">BenchHub</a>). I also maintain some go libraries (see
            <a href="https://github.com/dyweb/gommon" target="_blank">gommon</a>) and is working on a DSL (see
            <a href="https://github.com/reikalang" target="_blank">Reika</a>).
            I spend most of my free time on
            <a href="https://github.com/at15" target="_blank">GitHub</a>, reinventing wheels and write about
            <a href="https://github.com/at15/papers-i-read" target="_blank">papers I read</a>
            and
            <a href="https://github.com/at15/code-i-read" target="_blank">code I read</a>. I am planning to combine them into a huge book
            <a href="https://github.com/at15/pub" target="_blank">at15/pub</a>, though I might be the only reader for the book.
        </p>

        <p>
            During my two years at UCSC (I didn't expect I would stay that long, thanks to my thesis committee). I did three things,
            wrote
            <a href="https://github.com/dyweb/gommon" target="_blank">gommon</a>, built
            <a href="https://github.com/xephonhq" target="_blank">Xephon</a>, designed
            <a href="https://github.com/benchhub" target="_blank">BenchHub</a> as my master thesis.
            <a href="https://github.com/xephonhq" target="_blank">Xephon</a> includes course projects for all my system and programming language related courses in UCSC (CMPS232,
            CMPS278, CMPS229, CMPS203, CMPS253).
            <a href="https://github.com/xephonhq/xephon-b">Xephon-B</a> is a benchmark tool,
            <a href="https://github.com/xephonhq/xephon-k">Xephon-K</a> is a multi backends TSDB with its own local persistent store.
            <a href="https://github.com/reikalang">Reika</a> is a DSL for time series database started in Xephon.
        </p>

        <p>
            I was a fullstack web developer and former president of
            <a href="http://dongyueweb.com/" target="_blank">Dongyue Web Studio</a>, where students build web and mobile applications. I lead the develop for
            <a href="http://tongqu.me"
                target="_blank">Tongqu</a>, an online campus event platform with more than 10,000 active users and tackled high concurrency problem
            with limited hardware resource.

                GitCafe is the first git hosting company in China, focusing on enterprise and education, it is now accquired by Coding.net.
                I met Rainux and Simsicon on Hackshanghai hackathon during road show and got an internship opportunity. I
                worked as a Ruby engineer at Beijing during winter vacation. I closed many tickets. My knowledge for Git
                itself and Git workflow increased a lot since GitCafe is a git hosting company.

                students major in computer science and internet security. It's the place where I started to learn real programming.
                Unlike course projects, I got chance to collaborate with experienced senior students and hear lectures from
                alumins working in Google, Microsoft. The product we developed is used by thousands of students in the campus
                and we also help startups to build their prototypes. I took an active part in the studio, though I majored
                in Material Science, my efforts let me stand out and end up being the president of the studio.
                (The true reason is most life winners in the studio chose to spend more time with their SO)

                I joined Prof. Cao's lab because I heard from collegues in the studio that he is looking for someone to develop a dashboard
                for a distributed system monitor prototype. Though I'm good at web development, I have more interest in doing
                lower level programming. So when the senior students left the project, I got the chance to refactor the old
                code. My knowledge for Java and computer network are limited to what is taught in the course. Thanks to this
                project I got to know how protocols work by design a simple plain text protocol to transform data and control
                probe's behaviour. Also I have made contribution to open source projects like KairosDB, a time series database
                based on Cassendra.

                Since I want to know more research environment and culture outside China. I spent my summer vacation as reseach assitant
                in Prof. He's group. A tax consultanting company in Melbourne want to know what's their customers estimated
                commerical value, most of them are sports man in Australia Football. I am repsponsible for collecting data
                and some minor text mining tasks. Since all the other students use C#, I gave up my favorite language PHP
                and wrote a crawler in C# and embed it in a ASP.NET web application. As for text mining, we need to figure
                out press and social media's opinion towards an athlete and combine with his performance to generate their
                commerical value rank. The project is still working in progress when I head back to Prof. Cao's lab, other
                two PHD students are still working on the text mining part to improve accurace and estimate the whole market
                value based on advertisement and press.
