        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>
            I am a first year master student in <a href="https://www.ucsc.edu/" target="_blank">University of California Santa Cruz</a> learning Computer Science.
            Interested in distributed systems, especially time series databases and Web development.
            I am <strong>looking for 2017 summer internship.</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          I am currently working on a distributed time series database benchmark suite called <a href="https://github.com/xephonhq/xephon-b">Xephon-B</a>,
          which is not only a benchmark tool, but also a platform where researchers and vendors can share their benchmark results including raw data.
          This a dogfooding project since I will use it on my master thesis project.
        </p>

        <p>
          For my master theis I am working on a <strong>hybrid distributed time series and graph databases</strong> to provide an easy to use inerface for complex query
          and fast data mining.
          <!-- I am also planning to apply GPU to the database -->
        </p>

        <p>
            I have done research in distributed system monitoring in <a href="http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/" target="_blank">Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China</a> with <a href="http://english.seiee.sjtu.edu.cn/english/detail/841_650.htm" target="_blank">Prof. Cao</a>            for 8 month on a collaborative project with China Telecom, Shanghai. During a two month visist in <a href="https://www.vu.edu.au/" target="_blank">Victoria University, Australia</a>, I have done research in web crawling and text mining with
            <a href="https://www.vu.edu.au/contact-us/jing-he" target="_blank">Prof. Jing</a> to estimate AFL sportsmen's comercial value.
        </p>

        <p>
            I am a fullstack web developer and former president of <a href="http://dongyueweb.com/" target="_blank">Dongyue Web Studio</a>, where students build web and mobile application for non-profit orgnizations and startups. I am also the former
            architect for <a href="http://tongqu.me" target="_blank">Tongqu</a>, an online campus event platform with more than 10,000 active users and solved high concurrency problem with limited hardware resouce.
        </p>

        <p>
            <!-- TODO: add links to refer to work and skills -->
            Before going to UCSC I studied Masterial Science in <a href="http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/" target="_blank">Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China</a> as my parents are all professors in related field. However I found I got more interest and talent
            in computer science. Apart from the CS sources I took in SJTU, the experience in Dongyue Web Studio is turly valueable. I got chance to learn cutting edge technologies in web development and parctice with amazing collegues on real projects
            like Tongqu. Started as a novice front end developer and ended up being a full stack developer and the studio president, I gained experience about team work and how to let the project ship in time - stop creating wheels and over optimization,
            iterate rapidly.
        </p>

        <p>
            I am quite active on <a href="https://github.com/at15">GitHub</a>, contributing to opensource projects and creating wheels with my friends in <a href="https://github.com/dyweb">Dongyue Web Studio</a> and <a href="https://github.com/tongquhq">Tongqu</a>.
            As for my master theis about distributed time series database you have a look at <a href="https://github.com/xephonhq" target="_blank">Xephon</a>

            <p>
                GitCafe is the first git hosting company in China, focusing on enterprise and education, it is now accquired by Coding.net. I met Rainux and Simsicon on Hackshanghai hackathon during road show and got an internship opportunity. I worked as a Ruby engineer
                during school's winter vacation. I closed a lot of tickets and fixed some nasty encoding problem caused by third party libraries. Also my knowledge for Git itself and Git workflow increased a lot since GitCafe is a git hosting company.
            </p>
            <p>
                Following is my contribution during internship at GitCafe
                <ul>
                    <li>Optimize markdown ruby parser</li>
                    <li>Fix encoding problem in rugged</li>

            <p>
                <a href="http://www.dongyueweb.com" target="_blank">Dongyue Web Studio</a> is formed by students from Shanghai Jiao Tong University. Most of them are undergraduate students major in computer science and internet security. It's the place where I started to learn real programming. Unlike course projects, I got chance to collobarte with experienced senior students and hear lectures from alumins working in Google, Microsoft. The product we developed is used by thousands of students in the campus and
                we also help startups to build their prototype. I took an active part in the studio, though I majored in Material Science, my efforts let me stand out and end up being the president of the studio.

        <div>
          <h4><i>University of California Santa Cruz</h4>
          <p>
            I am working on Xephon-B <a href="https://github.com/xephonhq/xephon-b" target="_blank">A time series benchmark tool</a> for my distributed system class.
            I am also working with PhD student on distributied systems consistency validation using
            <a href="http://jepsen.io/" target="_blank">Jepsen</a>
            For my master thesis I am planning to build a hybird time series and graph database for analytics.

            <h4><i>Research Assitant</i>&nbsp;Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China</h4>
            <p>
                I joined Prof. Cao's lab because I heard from collegues in the studio that he is looking for someone to develop a dashboard for a distributed system monitor prototype. Though I'm good at web development, I have more interest in doing lower level programming.
                So when the senior students left the project, I got the chance to refactor the old code. My knowledge for Java and computer network are limited to what is taught in the course. Thanks to this project I got to know how protocols work by
                design a simple plain text protocol to transform data and control probe's behaviour. Also I have made contribution to open source projects like KairosDB, a time series database based on Cassendra.

            <h4><i>Research Assitant</i>&nbsp;Victoria University, Australia</h4>
            <p>
                Since I want to know more research environment and culture outside China. I spent my summer vacation as reseach assitant in Prof. He's group. A tax consultanting company in Melbourne want to know what's their customers estimated commerical value, most
                of them are sports man in Australia Football. I am repsponsible for collecting data and some minor text mining tasks. Since all the other students use C#, I gave up my favorite language PHP and wrote a crawler in C# and embed it in a ASP.NET
                web application. As for text mining, we need to figure out press and social media's opinion towards an athlete and combine with his performance to generate their commerical value rank. The project is still working in progress when I head
                back to Prof. Cao's lab, other two PHD students are still working on the text mining part to improve accurace and estimate the whole market value based on advertisement and press.
